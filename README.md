# Cookie Steganography

![Cookie Steganography](https://example.com/cookie_steganography.png)

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a cookie steganography technique, which involves hiding data within HTTP cookies. Cookie steganography is a form of steganography where data is embedded within cookies exchanged between a web server and a client.

## Features

- Encode secret messages into HTTP cookies
- Decode hidden messages from HTTP cookies
- Support for various encoding and decoding techniques
- Simple and intuitive API for integration into web applications

## Usage

To encode a message into a cookie:

```python
from cookie_steganography import CookieSteganography

message = "This is a secret message"
cookie = CookieSteganography.encode(message)
print("Encoded cookie:", cookie)
```

To decode a message from a cookie:

```python
from cookie_steganography import CookieSteganography

cookie = "encoded_cookie_value"
message = CookieSteganography.decode(cookie)
print("Decoded message:", message)
```

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```
pip install cookie-steganography
```

## Examples

Check out the [examples](./examples) directory for usage examples and sample code snippets.
